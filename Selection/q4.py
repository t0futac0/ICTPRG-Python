#Q4. Strings are compared using the ASCII values A to Z are represented by numbers 65 to 90. 
# A to z are represented by 97 to 122. Digits 0 to 9 are stored in memory as characters by numbers 48 to 57. 
# Blank space by 32

#What will be the output of this code?
#if  ‘z’ < ‘a’:
#    print (‘ z is less than a”)
#else :
#     print(‘ z is not less than a’)


if 'z' < 'a':
    print('z is less than a')
else:
    print('z is not less than a')

#z is not less than a
